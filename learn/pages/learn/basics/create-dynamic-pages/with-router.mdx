import Layout from '~/components/Layout'

export const meta = {

}

## withRouter

As you can see, that code will throw an error like this:

![](/learn/static/images/withrouter-error.png)

That's because we're injecting the `router` property into the `Page` component by calling `withRouter` on it.
`withRouter` can be used on any component in your Next.js application. So in this case we can move the `withRouter` call to the `Content` component:

```js
import { withRouter } from 'next/router'
import Layout from '../components/MyLayout'

const Content = withRouter(props => (
  <div>
    <h1>{props.router.query.title}</h1>
    <p>This is the blog post content.</p>
  </div>
))

const Page = props => (
  <Layout>
    <Content />
  </Layout>
)

export default Page
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
